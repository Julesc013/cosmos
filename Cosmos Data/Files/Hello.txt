Hello!,


This is a text file (.txt) used to test opening files and editing files.

Did you know you can use the "type" command to display the contents of a document on the screen? 
It works for .txt files because they have no formatting.
You can use this command like:
	"type [(file directory\)file]"
	Example: type A:\README.TXT
	Example: type C:\FILES\DOCUMENT\NUL.TXT


That's all,
Jules
